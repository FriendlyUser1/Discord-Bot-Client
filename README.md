# Discord Bot Client (web version)

Discord's client is great, but doesn't allow you to control a bot account.

## About

### What this will let you do

With this application, you will be able to fully control your bot as a user, like sending and viewing messages in servers or DMs.

### Disclaimer

- This application is still being developed, expect bugs.
- I cannot get your bot's token from you putting it into this program.
